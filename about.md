Hey there! My name is Ben and I like computers. Whether its writing a ... or setting up my own cloud on a Raspberry Pi, ... . Oh and I automize about everything with Python and Bash scripts, there is really no reason to do something twice on a computer. When it comes to text editors, I am a vim fan and to be honest, its the best one. When I started programming (I got a C book for my 13. birthday), I always dreamed of becoming a game developer. I spent quite some time programming small games with only the console as output until I realized that there is something called libraries and you don't have to code everything on your own from scratch. The biggest project was probably a 2D Jump and Run game I developed with a good friend in our last years of school. However, I luckily realized that being a game developer might not be as fun as it sounds and also stumbled upon Web Security at the same time. I quickly got fascinated by the topic and have been passionate about IT-Security since.

# # University

I started my studies at the RWTH Aachen University back in 2012. Although the degree is more geared towards theoretical computer science, I managed to pick up quite some experience in programming due to side projects and working at the university during that time. I started out with a tutor job for the programming lecture in the third semester and transitioned to working at the SensorCloud project after one semester. 



The computer science degree is a bit heavier on theoritacal subjects than the degree program's of other universities with only a small section for programming. However, I picked up a tutor job for the programming lecture in the third semester and transitioned to work at the SensorCloud project in my fourth semester. Those jobs besides university are a good way to practice your coding skills. First time I interacted with Linux and Git and all this good stuff. The project was a C based secure cloud thingy. I wrote my bachelor's thesis "..." in the sixth semester at the IT-Security Research Group. Allowed me to dive deeper into cryptography and secure protocol design.   

Contrary to popular belief, you don't learn how to program in universtiy. Especially as the RWTH University offers a more theory based degree, programming skills are acquired during the free time. It is really helpful to have some side projects. After all, I recommend studying at RWTH as the quality of the eduction is good. Even though IT-Security is not a strong focus in the curriculum, the master allows for great freedom and one is able to properly specialize on IT-Security. Currently studying the master and working at the IT-Security Research Group.
